             <p class="tech">I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior knowledge in software development. However, within a few weeks, 
                I was able to grasp the crux of software development and also master the soft skills required for being a software developer.
                So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing push in my career as a software developer.
